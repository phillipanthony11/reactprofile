# React Portfolio

## Description:

Our homework was to create a profile to show possible employers. It was a requirment to use React and that out profile would be a single page application. We were required to use 6 images in our portfolio section with links to the deployed applications and github repositories. The about me section contains a short bio and a photo of myself. The portfolio had one component, "projects" to store info. The content section has a form with form field validation, and the resume had my skills with a downloadable pdf.
